## Overview

Git hooks are scripts that are located in the [`./scripts/githooks`](../../scripts/githooks) directory. They are executed automatically on each commit, provided that the `make config` command has been run locally to set up the project. These same scripts are also part of the CI/CD pipeline execution. This setup serves as a safety net and helps to ensure consistency.

The [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework is a powerful tool for managing Git hooks, providing automated hook installation and management capabilities.

```
